# Living on the Cloud 

This workshop demonstrates how to rapidly build, test, and deploy a Spring Boot applicationto a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud. This workshop closely follows the content of the blog series [Living on the Cloud]((https://developer.ibm.com/series/living-on-the-cloud/)). 

Each exercise in this project is its own branch.

## Deploy Spring Boot to Kubernetes 

In the first exercise we will quickly deploy a Spring Boot application to a Kubernetes Cluster: [Code](https://github.com/wkorando/spring-boot-cloud-native-workshop/tree/1-deploying-spring-boot)

## Connecting to a Database

In the second exericse we will connect the Spring Boot application we built in the first exercise to a database: [Code](https://github.com/wkorando/spring-boot-cloud-native-workshop/tree/2-connecting-to-a-database)

## Cloud Native Integration Teting

In the second exericse we will use TestContainers and Spring Cloud Contract to handle test the Integration Testing of our Spring Boot application so that it is reliable and portable: [Code](https://github.com/wkorando/spring-boot-cloud-native-workshop/tree/3-cloud-native-integration-testing)
